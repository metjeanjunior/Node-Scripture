# this repo holds a nodejs application to display a bible scripture on a secondary screen

## It was built as a proof of concept to show a friend so do not mind sloppy code and features not working. It served its purpose :)

* It uses Electronjs for packaging
* JSon as means of storage (SQLite Under Development)
* JS as the mean to display the scripture on the second screen
* I used the versions found [here](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases/tree/master/json)
* The resources folder was originally part of the .gitignore file but, I decided to upload it because why not `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
